## About the project
This is a clone of the popular online marketplace that connects people renting out a property with those who want to rent it, Airbnb. Catbnb was created using React, Redux, Bcrypt, Csurf, Express.js, Helmet, and Sequelize. Catbnb will allow users to view spots that are listed for rental and to view the reviews for the spots available to rent. If a user is logged in they also have the ability to create a spot or to post a review of a spot. Users are able to edit the spots they've created or to delete the spots. Users are also able to delete reviews they've written on spots.
